Portfolio website
-
Although it may seem like this is just a small website, I still learned a little bit while making it. The most notable thing would be to have the colors, and some elements of style change dynamically depending on where the user is on the page, like the small dots on the right, or the navbar at the very top. I also learned how to make that smooth animation for the project, to have that div slide on top of the page from the side.

So, all in all, this website was still a good learning experience for me, especially since I made it kind of in a rush, because I needed it quickly, since I'm currently searching for an intership (this was written in early january 2025 in case I never update this). 

Thank you for taking the time to come to my portfolio, and take the time to even check out this project (even if it seems a bit pointless, since you already saw it).

As I said on the portfolio, if you have any questions, or issues about any projects of mine (or other ones I may not have mentioned on the website), please do not hesitate to contact me via eMail, LinkedIn, or simply open an issue on the project on which you're having problems, I'll be happy to help you out.

Thank you again for reading this to the end, and have a nice day :)
